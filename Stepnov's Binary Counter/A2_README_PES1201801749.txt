1. This implementation is done using an array (dynamic) to store the temporary lists during transitions in number of matches played.
	1.1. A structure named node is used. It has two things data of int type and next which points to the another node.
2. No special compilation options required.
3. The output is in the format for all the arrays with greater than or equal to 2.
4. The code assumes that the numbers given to the function are within length elements. If this fails, junk integer value gets printed.
5. The code has used three helper functions.
	 5.1. Log is computed using a while loop.
	 5.2. Printing the lists
	 5.3. Creating the lists
6. The code also assumes the header file being used is "assignment_2.h".
7. Further, the output is printed onto 'STDOUT' and not into any file.
8. The size used is restricted to O((log n)^2).

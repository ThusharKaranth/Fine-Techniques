Fine Techniques Assignment 1:Memory Management
1. Allocation Policy :	FIRST FIT
2. Bookkeeping structure details :
	int flag -> 0 if free, and 1 if allocated.
	int size_of_block -> size of the allocated block.
	int next_index -> -1 if there is no next block, otherwise index to the next block.
3. A test main() function is commented in the implementation. It is neccesary to free 'extern char *p' in the client function to prevent memory leak.
4. Uses sequential search through all blocks to find free blocks -> O(n)
5. Transition form one block to another is through index element i in most functions. (next) index is used for displaying memory map.
6. Uses static int SIZE to store allocated size.
8. Uses BOOK_SIZE which stores book structure's size.
7. LOGIC:
	allocate(int n)
    	if(p is not NULL)
       		free(p);
       		p <- NULL;
    	dynamically allocating p using malloc function of char type
    	if(p is not NULL)
        	make a new book with next_index as -1,size_of_block as n-BOOK_SIZE
		SIZE <- n
	else
		SIZE <- 0
	
	mymalloc(int n)
	while(block i exists in p)
		initialize address to NULL
		if block i is not free or block size is lower than required
			i <- next block
		else
			point address to i
            		if the block size is more than the size+BLOCK_SIZE
				create a new book
				update the present book
				return address
			else
				update the present book
				return address
	return address
	
	myfree(void *b)
	while block i exists in p
		if b is equal to address of block i
			if previous block is present and free
				if next block is present
					if next block is free
						merge previous, present and next blocks and update previous block details
					else
						merge previous and present and update previous block details
				else
					merge previous and present and update previous block details
			else
				if next block is present 
					if next block is free
						merge present and next blocks and update present block details
					else
						update present block details
				else
					update present block details
			update present block details
		i <- next block

1) Compilation commands (in ubuntu)
		gcc -c A3_header_PES1201801749.h A3_client_PES1201801749.c
		gcc -c A3_header_PES1201801749.h A3_impl_PES1201801749.c
		gcc A3_impl_PES1201801749.o A3_client_PES1201801749.c
		./a.out
	In case make files are being used :
		a.out :	A3_impl_PES1201801749.o A3_client_PES1201801749.o
			gcc A3_impl_PES1201801749.o A3_client_PES1201801749.o
		A3_impl_PES1201801749.o :	A3_header_PES1201801749.h A3_impl_PES1201801749.c
			gcc -c A3_impl_PES1201801749.c
		A3_client_PES1201801749.o :	A3_header_PES1201801749.h A3_client_PES1201801749.c
			gcc -c A3_client_PES1201801749.c
2) The state is defined in a structure, and 6 possible transitions are implemented.
3) The order of the 6 functions are as mentioned in the word document
4) The list used is a doubly linked list, each node consists of a state and pointers to next and previous nodes.
5) The list structure holds the head and tail nodes of the list, so as to manipulate with ease.
6) Membership of state is checked using the is_repeated function
7) A wrapper function is called to get the total number of solutions and displaying the solutions.
8) This function is an example of a backtracking algorithm.
9) It uses the above functions and ignores repeating states.
10) At the end of the code, the algorithm for backtracking is shown.
11) Since it implements a backtracking algorithm, the space and time are combinatorial.
